let randomLoc = Math.floor(Math.random() * 5);		// Generate a number up to 4.99 , clip off the decimal.  

// Now we use the above to assign locations:  
		let location1 = randomLoc; 
		let location2 = location1++ ; 
		let location3 = location2++ ; 

		//I should now be able to edit my battleship code to make it generate random locations each time.
