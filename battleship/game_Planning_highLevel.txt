JAVASCRIPT TECHNIQUES NEEDED: 
	variables, numbers, strings, if statements, conditional tests, loops. ((More advanced:  functions, math.floor, math.random for random number generation))   

 This game is the same idea as your basic 'battleship' game. There is a grid which we try to locate where the ships are hidden after being automatically generated.

For this version of the game, at this stage of our understanding of JavaScript, it will be a simple 1 line grid of seven squares.  

The ships will take up 3 grid squares at this point.  

What follows below is basic description and planning for this program, as written directly from the book:  */


1)  The user starts the game. 
	a) A battleship is generated by the game at a random location on the grid.  
		b) This ship will be 3 squares long.  In the case of this program, the squares are 3 integers next to one another. (1, 2, 3, etc.) 

2)  The main playing of the game begins, and continues until the game is won (the ship is sank).  
		The game will repeat this logic till the game is won: 
	a)  Ask (prompt) the user to guess what grid the ship is on. 
		Example:  ("2", "0")
	b)  Check the user's grid square guess against the battleship's location. 
		Based on the location, return either a hit, a miss or a sink message to the user.  

3)  Finish the game , and tell the user a rating/score based on how many attempts it took them to sink it.    




/*  COMMENT ABOUT THE PLANNING
	This planning is described in the book as 'high level'.  
	I assume this means that it's a description of what's needed to complete the program, 
		WITHOUT getting into the nitty gritty, complex details of how to actually manage each step yet.
