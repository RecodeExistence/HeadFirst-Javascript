// Battleship Game PseudoCode  
// Written from page 87/704


//Variables: 

Declare three variables to hold where each cell of the ship generates:  
	location1
	location2
	location3

Declare a variable to hold the users current guess:  
	guess 

Declare a variable to hold the number of hits, set it to 0 to start with:  
	hits

Declare a variable to hold the number of guesses, set it to 0:  
	guesses

Declare a variable to keep track of whether the ship is sunk, and set it to false (the variable value is boolean, and should let us know whether to exit the loop): 
	isSunk


//LOOP , while the ship is not sunk:  
	Get the user's guess (put it into the variable called guess). 
	Compare the user's input to valid input values (check it's actually a number, and in the number range we need).  

	IF the users guess is invalid: 
		Tell the user to enter a valid number (use prompt again, but with a slightly different message?).

//ELSE
	The user has guessed again, so increment the guesses variable value by one.  
	// IF the users guess matches a location in the variables, location1, location2, or location3
		Increment the value of the hits variable by 1.  
			
			//IF the number of the hits variable reaches 3
				Set the isSunk boolean value from false to true.  
				Tell the user they sank the battleship.  

			End the IF that checks the hits variable value
		End the IF that checks if the users guess matches a location of the ships cells. 
	END the else of the LOOP.
Give the user their stats.
