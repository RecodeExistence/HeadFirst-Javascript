<!-- This document is linked with battleship.js , an exercise in the HeadFirst Javascript Book. 
	It is very very simple html, just to give us a page to play the game on.
		This HTML document can be greatly modified later, and probably will be built upon later in the book.  
		Don't be afraid to make another version of this document to screw about with some ideas though.
