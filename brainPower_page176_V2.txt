1)  list all solutions and their corresponding scores:  
	var scores = [60, 50, 60, 58, 54, 54,
	58, 50, 52, 54, 48, 69,
	34, 55, 51, 52, 44, 51,
	69, 64, 66, 55, 52, 61,
	46, 31, 57, 52, 44, 18,
	41, 53, 55, 61, 51, 44];

	function listScores(array) {
		for(let i = 0 ; i < array.length ; i++) {
		console.log(`Bubble solution # ${i} score: ${array[i]}`);

		}

	}	//This code is a working example for this section of the question.  


// 2)  Print the total number of bubble scores:  
	function arrayLength(array) {
	let totalNumScores = array.length ;
	return totalNumScores;
	}	// This code is a working example for this section of the question. 


//	3)  Followed by the highest score: 
	function getHighest(array) {
		let highestNumber = 0;  

	for(let i = 0 ; i < array.length ; i++) {
		if(array[i] >= highestNumber) {
			highestNumber = array[i];
			}
		}
	// Assign highest score to a variable, return for later use.  
	let returnedHighest = highestNumber; 
		return returnedHighest; 
}

	3b) Also grab the indexes the high scores were at:
