# HeadFirst-Javascript
Code built from the HeadFirst Javascript Book.  

This codebase is built from chapter 2 of the HeadFirst Javascript Book.  
Any text files added to this repository are exercises and questions from the book , answered and written in my own hand.  

The "battleship.js" file is heavily commented, for my own learning process.  The program itself is actually very short when 
the comments are removed.  

The battleship.html file is, as it would seem, the webpage itself that the js is linked to.  

Finally, the basic_Quality_Assurance.txt file outlines any quality/debugging issues.  These haven't been dealt with as of yet, but I'll be 
looking to fix them and add to this program as I work through the book.  


TL;DR : Main files are battleship.js , battleship.html.  
        The game is buggy/exploitable at the moment, but I'm aware of it and will work on it.
